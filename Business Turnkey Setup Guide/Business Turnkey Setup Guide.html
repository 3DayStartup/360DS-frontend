		<p><img src="assets/backend_main_1_bus_info.jpg" width="524" height="490" alt="Business Information" /><br />
		<span class="figure">[fig. 2.1 Business Information]</span></p>
		<p><strong>Business Name:<br />
		</strong>Once you fill this out, your business name will show up in the header (unless you also designate a logo in &quot;<strong>Your Logo URL</strong>&quot; below), and it will show up in the footer with your physical address.</p>
		<p><img src="assets/header_highlight_name.jpg" width="600" height="92" alt="business name in header" /><br />
		<span class="figure">[fig. 2.0.2 Business Name in Header]</span></p>

		  <li>If you use the <strong>media uploader</strong> link, remember that it will open in a new tag or window</li>
		  <li>After you have uploaded the image, copy the <strong>URL</strong> of the image in the<em> media uploader</em> window:</li>
		</ul>
		<p><img src="assets/media_uploader.jpg" width="450" height="420" alt="media uploader" /></p>

		<h4 id = "style">2.2 Theme Style and Display <a class = "top" href = "#toc">[ top ]</a></h4>
		<p><img src="assets/backend_main_2_theme_style_display.jpg" width="522" height="325" alt="theme style and display" /><br />
		<span class="figure">[fig. 2.2 Theme Style and Display]</span></p>
		<p><strong>Select a style:</strong><br />
		There are three different styles to choose from: <strong>Modern</strong>, <strong>Textured</strong> and <strong>Corporate</strong>. Each has its own set of colors and images. This will change the entire look of the site.</p>
		<p><strong>Select a font style:</strong><br />
		There are also three different font styles: <strong>Bebas Neue and Georgia</strong>, <strong>Eau and Lucida Grande and Verdana</strong>, and <strong>Chunk Five and Carto Gothic</strong>. Each of these font configurations is different, and you can mix and match them with the different styles above to create a totally unique look to your preference. Each of the fonts is loaded in the theme, so it doesn't matter if visitors have those fonts installed in their computers or not- they will display as listed. </p>
		<p><strong>Blog Entries:</strong><br />
		  If you want to have blog entries displayed on the home page, you can click this box. Some users choose not to have their blog entries show up on their home page, opting for a smaller screen size with less scrolling on the home page. Others want the blog. It's your choice.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Blog Entry Dates:</strong><br />
		  Some users may not want to display the date on the blog entries because they do not update them very often, or they just choose not to have them. Check the box to display the date on your entries. Uncheck it to remove the date.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Number of Columns:</strong><br />
		You may have <strong>one</strong>, <strong>two</strong> or <strong>three columns</strong> for your blog and sidebar on the home page. Remember, if you choose one column, your sidebars display underneath your blog, and if you choose two columns, your sidebars are stacked upon each other. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	
		<h4 id = "social">2.3 Social Networks <a class = "top" href = "#toc">[ top ]</a></h4>
		<p><img src="assets/backend_main_3_social_networks.jpg" width="521" height="377" alt="social networks" /><br />
		<span class="figure">[fig. 2.3 Social Networks]</span></p>

		<p><img src="assets/backend_main_4_featured_text.jpg" width="523" height="388" alt="featured text" /><br />
		<span class="figure">[fig. 2.4 Featured Text]</span></p>
		<p>To fill in the area underneath the slider, enter information into the following areas of <em>Featured Text</em>:</p>
		<p><img src="assets/featured_text.jpg" width="600" height="88" alt="featured text" /></p>
		<ul>
		  <li><strong>Intro Text</strong> is the paragraph you wish to display directly below the slider section, which most companies use as an intro to their &quot;about us&quot; section, or perhaps a latest promotion you want visitors to click through to.</li>
		  <li>The <strong>button</strong> on this section has two pieces of text: the <strong>Intro Button Main</strong> and the <strong>Intro Button Subtext</strong>.</li>
		  <li>Lastly, the <strong>Intro Button Link</strong> should contain the <em>URL</em> that you wish the button to lead visitors to.<br />
		  </li>
		</ul>
	
	
		<h4 id = "slider">2.5 Rotating Slider <a class = "top" href = "#toc">[ top ]</a></h4>
		<p>The rotating slider is the first section of the theme directly below the header. In this section you can display images, text and even video. To configure this you can click on <strong>Configure Here</strong> under <em>Rotating Slider</em> in your <em>Theme Options</em> page:</p>
		<p><img src="assets/backend_main_5_rotating_slider.jpg" width="523" height="110" alt="rotating slider" /><br />
		<span class="figure">[fig. 2.5 Rotating Slider]</span></p>

	  <p><img src="assets/turnkey_slider.jpg" width="153" height="78" alt="turnkey slider" /></p>
		<p>When you click on <strong>Add New</strong>, you are taken to the<em> Turnkey Slider Add New Post</em> page, where you can enter the <strong>Title</strong>, <strong>Body</strong>, the <strong>text</strong> that will appear on a button if you choose to have one, and the <strong>URL</strong> you want that link to lead to.

		<p><img src="assets/featuredimage_backend.jpg" width="600" height="505" alt="Featured Image" /></p>
		<p>Once uploaded, choose <em>Use as Featured Image</em> and your image will be set for that slider post.</p>
<p><img src="assets/sliderpost.jpg" width="450" height="408" alt="slider post" /></p>

		<p><img src="assets/slider.jpg" width="600" height="243" alt="slider" /></p>
		<p>For each slider post that you enter, each of them will rotate automatically for the user. If you only upload one slider post, it will remain static. To manage your slider posts, go to <strong>Turnkey Slider</strong> under the<em> Turnkey Slider</em> dashboard menu item.</p>
	
	
	  <h4 id = "widgets">2.6 Widgets <a class = "top" href = "#toc">[ top ]</a></h4>
		<p>There are 4 different sets where widgets will appear in your theme: <strong>Homepage Widgets</strong>, <strong>Sidebar 1</strong>, <strong>Sidebar 2</strong> and <strong>Footer Widgets</strong>. </p>
		<p>You can customize your widgets by choosing <strong>Widgets </strong>under<strong> <em>Appearance</em></strong> in the <strong>dashboard menu</strong>. You will find a link to the widgets page in your Turnkey page  as well:</p>
		<p><img src="assets/backend_main_6_widgets.jpg" width="522" height="90" alt="widgets" /><br />
	    <span class="figure">[fig. 2.6 Widgets]</span> </p>
		<ul>
		  <li><strong>Homepage Widgets</strong>: these three widgets will show up right below your <strong>featured text area</strong>, which is located just below the <strong>slider</strong>.</li>
		  <li><strong>Sidebar 1</strong> and <strong>Sidebar 2</strong>: These show up on your home page. Depending on how many columns you choose these will either show up under your blog (one column), to the right of the blog stacked upon each other (two column) or to the right of your blog as columns 2 and 3.</li>
		  <li><strong>Footer Widgets</strong>: these are the 3 widgets that will show up above your footer.</li>
	    </ul>
		<p>If you are unfamiliar with using Widgets, you can learn more about it in the WordPress codex, found here: <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets" target="_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets</a></p>
<h4 id = "menus">2.7 Menus &amp; Navigation <a class = "top" href = "#toc">[ top ]</a></h4>
		<p>This theme utilizes a feature first introduced in Wordpress 3.0: Custom Menus. Once you have created your menus, you can use the information below to configure the placement of your menus. If you are unfamiliar with custom menus, you can learn more at <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Menus_SubPanel" target="_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Menus_SubPanel</a></p>
		<p><img src="assets/backend_main_7_menus_navigation.jpg" width="521" height="112" alt="menus &amp; navigation" /><br />
		  <span class="figure">[fig. 2.7 Menus &amp; Navigation]</span></p>
		<p>Your menus both show up in the header of your site. If you choose Configure here under menus, or whether you choose Menus under the Appearance section of your dashboard menu, you will be taken to a page to customize your menus. In order to have your menus displayed, make sure you have two menus created, and then choose the following choices in the Theme Locations setting of the Menus page:</p>
		<p><img src="assets/menu_options.jpg" width="289" height="239" alt="menu locations" /></p>
		<ul>
		  <li><strong>Turnkey Secondary Navigation: </strong>This shows up in the top-most bar</li>
		  <li><strong>Turnkey Main Navigation:</strong> This shows up below the top navigation</li>
		</ul>
	  <p>They will show up in the places shown below:</p>
		<p><img src="assets/navigation.jpg" width="600" height="92" alt="navigation" /></p>
	  <h4 id = "blog">2.8 Creating a &quot;Blog&quot; Page Sep<a class = "top" href = "#toc">[ top ]</a>arate from the Index Page</h4>
		<p>Natively, the Business Turnkey offers you two options for displaying your blog posts. You can either choose your posts to show up on your home page, or you can choose to hide that section.</p>
		<p>If you do use blog posts, and you would like to have your blog listed in your navigation on a separate page of your website, follow the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>Create a page on your website named &quot;Blog&quot; or whatever you would like to call it.</li>
		  <li>In the menu options for that page, choose <strong>&quot;Blog Page&quot;</strong> from the dropdown menu under <strong>Page Attributes &gt;&gt; Template</strong>.</li>
		  <li>Add this new page to one of your menus</li>
	  </ol>
		<p>Your blog posts will now be displayed on the page that you created. You still have the choice to display them on your home page or not.</p>
        
      <h4 id = "featuredimage">2.9 Using Featured Images in your Blog Posts</h4>
		<p>Want to display images in your blog archives? The Business Turnkey Theme is designed to display featured images at the top of your excerpts on the blog archives, as well as at the top of the blog posts.</p>
		<p><img src="assets/featuredimage_600px.jpg" width="600" height="261" alt="Featured Image" /></p>
		<p>In order to display featured images, you will need to utilize Wordpress's Featured Image feature, housed within the menu on every blog page.</p>
		<p><img src="assets/featuredimage_backend.jpg" width="600" height="505" alt="featured image" /></p>
		<p>When you use the featured image from within a blog post, it will crop your image to the appropriate size and save additional thumbnail sizes. Whenever you change the number of columns you use, the theme will use the appropriately sized image, so that it always matches the theme design.</p>
		<p>If you would also like to use the full-sized version of your image, you may upload it to the content of your blog post.</p>
  </div>

	<div class = "indent">
		<h4 id = "customcss">3.1 Custom CSS <a class = "top" href = "#toc">[ top ]</a></h4>
		<p>If you would like to change the design of this theme, you just have to find the element's class or id and you can define your own styles within the <strong>custom.css</strong> file located in the theme's directory. This stylesheet is blank by default and is loaded last so any changes here will override what we have provided.</p>
		<p>A basic example would be if you wanted to style all the H3 tags to be blue. You would add <span style = "font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">h3 { color: blue; }</span> to <strong>custom.css</strong> and all the H3 tags will now be blue.
